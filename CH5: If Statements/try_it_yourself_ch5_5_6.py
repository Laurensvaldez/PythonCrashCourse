# write an if-elif-else chain that determines a person's stage of life. Set a value for the variable age, and then:

person = int(1.99)

if person <2:
    print ("You are a baby.")
elif person <4:
    print ("You are a toddler.")
elif person <13:
    print("You are a kid.")
elif person <20:
    print("You are a teenager.")
elif person <65:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are an elder.")
